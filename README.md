### üîê Admin Panel Access

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: For simplicity during development, the Admin Panel can be accessed directly without login authentication.
You can access the Admin Panel directly by visiting:
```bash
http://localhost:5173/AdminPanel
```
- No login is required.
- This bypass is intended for demonstration purposes only.
- In a production environment, proper authentication and role-based access control should be enforced
